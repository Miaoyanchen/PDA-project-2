@article{Breslau:1992aa,
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Earlier, the authors reported on the association of nicotine dependence with major depression and anxiety disorders in a group of young adults. This report describes the occurrence of withdrawal symptoms and their sociodemographic and psychiatric correlates in persons in that group who tried unsuccessfully to abstain from smoking. METHOD: A random sample of 1,007 members of a health maintenance organization, 21-30 years old, were interviewed with a revised version of the NIMH Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Data on nicotine withdrawal came from a subset of 239 smokers who had tried unsuccessfully to quit or cut down on smoking. RESULTS: With two exceptions, each of the DSM-III-R nicotine withdrawal symptoms was reported by more than one-half of these smokers. Withdrawal symptoms were more severe in white than in black smokers but were unrelated to sex, educational level, or marital status. Persons with histories of major depression or any anxiety disorder reported more severe withdrawal symptoms than persons with neither of these disorders. Severity of withdrawal, or any specific symptom, did not account for the association between major depression and continued smoking. Furthermore, severity of withdrawal was unrelated to continued smoking. CONCLUSIONS: While the long-term clinical significance of nicotine withdrawal is unclear, the evidence indicates that in the general population, abstinence from smoking is associated with a variety of disturbances, including a craving for cigarettes, dysphoria, and symptoms of irritability or nervousness. In this study disturbances were more severe in persons with histories of major depression or anxiety disorders.},

@article{Hitsman:2023aa,
	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Treatment of depression-related psychological factors related to smoking behavior may improve rates of cessation among adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study measured the efficacy and safety of 12 weeks of behavioral activation for smoking cessation (BASC), varenicline and their combination. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This study used a randomized, placebo-controlled, 2 × 2 factorial design comparing BASC versus standard behavioral treatment (ST) and varenicline versus placebo, taking place in research clinics at two urban universities in the United States. Participants comprised 300 hundred adult smokers with current or past MDD. INTERVENTIONS: BASC integrated behavioral activation therapy and ST to increase engagement in rewarding activities by reducing avoidance, withdrawal and inactivity associated with depression. ST was based on the 2008 PHS Clinical Practice Guideline. Both treatments consisted of eight 45-min sessions delivered between weeks 1 and 12. Varenicline and placebo were administered for 12 weeks between weeks 2 and 14. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were bioverified intent-to-treat (ITT) 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at 27 weeks and adverse events (AEs). FINDINGS: No significant interaction was detected between behavioral treatment and pharmacotherapy at 27 weeks (χ(2) ((1))  = 0.19, P = 0.67). BASC and ST did not differ (χ(2) ((1))  = 0.43, P = 0.51). Significant differences in ITT abstinence rates (χ(2) ((1))  = 4.84, P = 0.03) emerged among pharmacotherapy arms (16.2% for varenicline, 7.5% for placebo), with results favoring varenicline over placebo (rate ratio = 2.16, 95% confidence interval = 1.08, 4.30). All significant differences in AE rates after start of medication were higher for placebo than varenicline. CONCLUSION: A randomized trial in smokers with major depressive disorder found that varenicline improved smoking abstinence versus placebo at 27 weeks without elevating rates of adverse events. Behavioral activation for smoking cessation did not outperform standard behavioral treatment, with or without adjunctive varenicline therapy.},
